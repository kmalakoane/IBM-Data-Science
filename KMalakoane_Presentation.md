<br/>
![CRISP-DM](https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/crisp-dm-4-problems-fig1.png) <br/>

### K-Means Clustering
The implementation of the K Means needs a declaration of a K or the number of clusters.<br/>
Using the Elbow Method an optimal K can be determined. The optimal K found using the method is 4 clusters.<br/>

## Discussion
<br/> Using the Foursquare API, different establishments and geographical locations can be retrieved.
<br/> However, one limitation of the data is that it is user based. Locations which are less popular to Foursquare useds can have less or thin dataset.
<br/> Cluster 2 is consist of district with the fewest establishments. The data for the Cluster 2 for the districts of Pandacan and Tondo was the smallest with 16 and 24 retrieved establishments, respectively.
<br/> Geographically, Majority of big districts in big clusters were either near bodies of water or near rail road tracks. This suggests that most business build their establishments near possible transportation routes.
<br/> The districts Cluster 0 were near bodies of waters. Majority of Establishments can be found on Cluster 1, which is along the Rail Road Tracks.
<br/> Food-related and Convenience Store were the majority establishment types located in manila. This suggests that food-related business is very abundant in each districts. The most frequent food establishments were Chinese Restaurants.
<br/> Since manila is consist of residential areas convinence store is also an abudant business venture.

## Conclusion 
<br/> This project focused on geographical data to implement the CRISP-DM pipeline in exploring the establishment concentration in the 17 District of Manila Philippines.
<br/>Using the K-Means clustering algirithm and Elbow plot method, an optimal 4 clusters were identified and analyzed.
<br/>It was found that most clusters were near bodies of water or rail road tracks. The most frequent establishment types were Food-related and Convenience Store. 
<br/> The governement can utilize this results to check the sustainability of the number of establishments on the identified clusters.
