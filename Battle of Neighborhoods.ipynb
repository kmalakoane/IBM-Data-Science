    "* What are the near neighborhoods of Manhattan and top venues in each neighborhood.\n",
    "+ What are the average rental amount for studio, 1 bedroom,2 bedrooms & 3 bedrooms apartment in each of these neighborhoods\n",

    "Once the Manhattan Neighborhoods were known, second task is to find out the average rent of different size of apartments in each neighborhood.Here, the rentcafe page was scraped and wrangled the data, cleaned it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "At last,merged both the data sets across column on Neighborhood and applied Machine Learning- K means Clustering algorithm to cluster the neighborhoods in to 5 different clusters (k=5).\n",

    "As the average rent ranges USD 2,170- 5,363 so John has lot of option to choose\n",
    "the best neighborhood for him & family. Here, he can opt the apartment based \n",
    "on his budget as he got a good range. Also, the venues are almost similar in these neighborhoods. \n",
    "So, if his budget allows to go for costlier apartments, he can opt Battery Park City with the maximum average rent of USD 5,363 and if not then he can opt Washington heights with minimum average rent USD 2,170.\n",
    "He can also choose the middle range neighborhoods in this cluster. Regarding venues, here he gets Cafe, different types of Restaurants, Park, Pizza Place, Gym, Bakery,Clothing stores which are the basic facilities.\n",
    "Basically, he has a very good collection of neighborhoods in this cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "With regards to second cluster , here the average rent is more than $4000 which means that if John has a very limited budget, then this cluster will not be good for him as it doesnt give him options with lesser rental apartments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third & Fourth cluster have just 1 neighborhood in them and they dont give John the chance to choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Fifth cluster,the average rental range is $3,526 - 4,018. These are the middle range apartments in the Manhattan neighborhoods.In case, John is looking for the mediocre neighborhoods (i.e. which is not too costly and have decent facilities) then he can opt this cluster to choose the best neighborhood."

    "The analysis done on the Manhattan neighborhood led us to 5 clusters and out of which the first and the fifth clusters were realized to be the good options for John to choose the best neighborhood which will fit all his needs/ expectations. \n",
    "\n",
    "It entirely depends on his budget and what all facilities are must for him (i.e if he is a fitness freak, he would definitely need Gym near to his apartment, if he is a big foodie then he will look for great restaurants near his apartment, if he has got sweet tooth then obviously he needs a bakery near by his house).\n",
    "\n",
    "This concludes Cluster 1 as the best neighborhood for him and it give him lot of such options to choose. "
